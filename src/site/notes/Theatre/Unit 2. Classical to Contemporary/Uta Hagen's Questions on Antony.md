# Uta Hagen's Questions on Antony



**Who am I?** This question’s answer includes all relevant details from name and age to physical traits, education, and beliefs. 
- Mark Antony was born on 14 January 83 BC
- Antony is vengeful, and with the power vacuum created from the death of Caesar, he aspires to not only kill the perpetrators but to ascend as the new ruler of Rome.

**What time is it?** Depending on the scene, the most relevant measure of time can be the era, the season, the day, or even the specific minute. 
- 44 BCE
- He has just been traumatized by the death of Caesar, his friend. This takes place in Spring, on 15th March. "The Ides of March"

**Where am I?** This answer covers the country, town, neighbourhood, room, or even the specific part of the room. 
-  Antony gives this speech in the town square of Rome after the death of Julius Caesar. Antony uses a confrontational tone accompanied with a judgmental attitude because he is attempting to persuade the people of Rome to disregard the words of Brutus and to move against the conspirators.
**What surrounds me?** Characters can be surrounded by anything from weather to furnishings, landscape, or people. 
- He is surrounded by a mob of Roman citizens, keen to understand the circumstances of Caesar's death. The town square provides optimum space to make important announcements, this one powerful than most. 
**What are the given circumstances?** Given circumstances include what has happened, what is happening, and what will happen to a character. 
- His impulsiveness and his inability to make decisions make him appear weak, but he is not as weak as he appears, as the play illustrates. He is sensual, but he is also brave, and he withstands adversity well.
- He is giving the soliloquy to the Roman citizens, in which he attempts to manipulate them into rebelling against Cassius and Brutus.
- Later, he is getting cross questioned by them and he must answer their questions while being diplomatic and manipulative at the same time.

**What are my relationships?** Relationships can be with other characters in the play, inanimate objects, or even recent events. 
- He underestimates Cassius' ability to manipulate, and is angered at the betrayal of Brutus, someone considered to also be Caesar's friend. He is angry that he trusted Cassius and thought of him nobly.

**What do I want?** 
- Antony's requests for safety and for an explanation for the murder are reasonable in the context of the situation, but Brutus' consent to provide both ensures that, upon returning to the Capitol, Antony can concentrate on his ultimate objective of gaining a forum. 

**What is in my way?** **What do I do to get what I want?** 
  - He needs to manipulate the crowd and his use of rhetoric to keep repeating that Brutus is an honourable *Roman*, just so that the crowd begins to disagree with this notion. He praises Caesar's accomplishments, implanting the notion that his death was *not* necessary.
