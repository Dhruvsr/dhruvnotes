# Contemporary Monologue

Bhaio aur Bheno, listen to what I have to say;
Today, I stand on the footsteps of the Vigyan Bhavan, and in your television screens.
I am not here to praise Jayshankar, or his ideologies towards shaping a better, more technologically advanced India. I am not here to say that his manifestos and campaigns would surely lead to not just the success of the party, but of India.
Birla and Chirag have stated that he was conceited, and they are respectable and righteous men.
The good qualities of a man is lost when he no longer possesses the power to exhibit them.
Birla and Chirag, the virtuous men, say that his pride was one of his many grievous faults, despite being a leader that led to the expansion of the party in multiple states and the improvement in how resources are allocated. Was this pride for himself, or pride for our country? Perhaps the adjectives which described him are a little extreme. But Birla and Chirag are trusted, honourable men. 
I am not disproving what they have said, or the methods where they successfully ousted Jayshankar through blackmail, for it is, as they say, for the greater good.
My heart is with those seeking to ensure unity in the party, sharing the fruits of its success with all its members and supports equally. Perhaps Jayshankar fulfilled such a quality, but Birla and Chirag say otherwise.
Now, I must pause as I organize my thoughts and consider the ongoing political turmoil as a result of their actions.
