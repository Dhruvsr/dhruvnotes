# Contemporary Monologue

Bhaio aur Bheno, meri bath suno;
Today, I stand on the footsteps of the Vigyan Bhavan, and your television screens.
I am not here to praise Jayshankar, or his ideologies towards shaping a better, more technologically advanced India. I am not here to say that his actions would surely lead to not just the success of the party, but even our "Bharat". 
Jayshankar understood us; he understood the inequalities. He understood what we went through!
Birla and Chirag said that Jayshankar was conceited... "and they are respectable and righteous men"
The good qualities of a man is lost when he no longer possesses the power to exhibit them. Have they even thought about the effects of their actions? and how it will affect us in the South? Will the political vacuum they have created be filled by a leader that once again ignores the necessities of the South? 
Birla and Chirag, the virtuous men, say that his pride was one of his many grievous faults, despite being a leader that led to the expansion of the party in multiple states and the improvement in how resources are allocated. Was this pride for himself, or pride for our country? Our Hindustan?
Perhaps the adjectives which described him are a little extreme. But Birla and Chirag are trusted, honourable men. 
I am not disproving what they have said, or the methods where they successfully ousted Jayshankar through blackmail, for it is, as they say, for the greater good.
My heart is with those seeking to ensure unity in the party, sharing the fruits of its success with all its members and supports equally. Perhaps Jayshankar fulfilled such a quality, but Birla and Chirag... they say otherwise. 
Now, I must pause, as I organize my thoughts and consider the ongoing political turmoil as a result of their actions.
