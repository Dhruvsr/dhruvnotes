# Julius Caesar by RSC
*Continued from offline notes*
- Antony had fled the scene, but then shakes hands with the murderers. They decide to speak to the crowd. When they left only Antony and Caesar's dead body, Antony cries for revenge.
- At Caesar’s funeral, the crowd demand an explanation from the murderers. He argues with logic and reason, saying that he loved Rome more than Caesar and asking the crowd if they would rather be free with Caesar dead or ‘slaves' with him alive. Interesting monologue here(?)
- Then Antony enters with Caesar’s body. He speaks with emotion, reminding the crowd of Caesar’s qualities and deliberately repeating that Brutus is ‘an honourable man'. Antony shows them the wounds on Caesar’s body, where each knife stabbed it before revealing Caesar’s will in which he has left the people of Rome money and land. Antony turns the crowd into an angry mob. This shows the intelligence of Antony. The conspirators run.
-  Antony meets with Lepidus and Octavius and discusses their plan to attack.
- There is a very well set up tent, it is realistic and shows the war situation well. Brutus waits for Cassius. Brutus thinks that Cassius is cooling in their friendship, and then Cassius accuses Brutus of wrongdoing. The argument escalates until they once again embraces. This shows that their relationship is not static. Brutus tells us that Portia killed herself.  He is visited by Caesar's ghost. Omen/Superstition once again.
- Brutus and Cassius enter with their armies and the two sets of leaders exchange insults. Cassius starts getting concerned, and he talks to Brutus about the situation if they lose. Brutus says he will never be taken captive and they bid farewell to each other.
- Cassius watches his troops flee Antony’s army. Cassius hears that Antony has entered his camp. He notes that it is his birthday, the day he is also likely to die: 'where I did begin, there shall I end’. Cassius then asks for himself to be killed with the same dagger used to stab Caesar.  Brutus then sees Cassius' body and fondly bids goodbye.
- Brutus bids his army farewell and asks to be killed also, but he is refused. He runs into his own sword and dies when Antony arrives, who praises him.
- There are interesting physical and verbal clashes here, and how Cassius' mental state is slowly descending into chaos. RSC has taken creative liberties here as they have made him stammer as well.
