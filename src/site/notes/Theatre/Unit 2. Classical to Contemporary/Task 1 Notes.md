## Doubt Clearing
- **Q:** How do we link the contextual research with the analysis for the overall narrative? Or is it completely differentiated?
	- **A:** Opening intro, connection to the UOI, Detailed contextual research, and then taking the production and decoding it. There are two methods. 1) Separating the contextual research 2)  Both can be synthesized by using the actual performance analysis intertwined with the contextual research where the knowledge and understanding is demonstrated.  *Use pictures as much as possible!*
- **Q:** Can we mention a sign which was meant to be conveyed a certain way but I as an audience member did not interpret during the performance.
	- **A:** Talk about where this understanding of Shakespearean drama is coming from? Show the tug of war and internal thoughts about the performance but don't be judgemental
- **Q:** Do we submit the tasks one at a time or altogether before the final submission date?
	- **A:** Send the first draft by 23/09, then improve based on the feedback provided by Vineet Sir, and then complete it. 
- **Q:** Do we mention why we as a theatre maker chose this play?
	- Yes. Be honest and rational.
