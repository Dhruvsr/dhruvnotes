# Chosen Skills
1) Characterisation: I will explore my character Mark Antony, from the costume to the voice to the body language
2) Production: How can the production elements be highly stylized and impactful?
3) How can I ensure the page â†’ stage process, making the piece contemporary but retaining some of the original elements?
