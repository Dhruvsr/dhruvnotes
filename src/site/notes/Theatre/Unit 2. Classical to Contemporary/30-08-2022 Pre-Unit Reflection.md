# Reflection
**1. Can Communication be Impacted by Time and Space**

**2. What is Performance Analysis(PA)? What are the 4 steps of performance analysis? What are the pragmatic and ideological purposes of PA?**
- Performance analysis is conducted by all theatre scholars, whether they are esteemed practitioners or just students. A performance analysis involves observing the Kowzan's thirteen signs which can be seen in the performance. The first step is to watch the performance, providing it undivided attention. Then, the student must look out for auditive and visual signs by the actor, and how it is correlated with the production elements such as stage appearance and inarticulate sounds. Finally, there is the appraisal where the conventions of the form can be connected to the performance itself.

**3. What are theatrical adaptations? How do we define it? How does it impact the world of theatre?**
Theatrical adaptations involve appropriately utilizing a particular form of theatre/a piece created in that form and adapting—or changing it—to either make it understandable in a modern context or synthesize it with another form to create a powerful message. They can be impactful

**4. What relationship is there between adaptation, performance and change?**
Adaptation refers to a modification or change of an existing performance. Adaptations can lead to a change in the perception or utilization of the form itself, which may be beneficial or detrimental to the performance.

**5. Why do you think it is important for theatre makers/learners to critique the theatre (created by us or others)?**
I believe that critique is important to improve oneself by recognizing others' mistakes, and in a collaborative activity, it can be a beneficial situation for the other theatre learner as well if the feedback is thoughtful and structured.

**6. How does the geographical given circumstances impact character? How does culture and time change communication?**
The geographical given circumstances can impact how a character and their persona is interpreted by the performer (thus affecting the performance) and the audience (thus affecting how the performance is understood). For example, Victorian Melodrama performance may be more impactful if it had Indian analogies and situations if performed in an Indian setting.
