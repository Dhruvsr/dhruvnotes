# Dead Man's Cell Phone
## Connection to Technology
The play Dead Man's Cell Phone uses the metaphor of a cell phone to explore the ways in which technology has changed the way we communicate and connect with one another. The cell phone in the play represents the way that technology has become a constant presence in our lives, and how it can both bring people together and drive them apart. For example, the main character, Jean, becomes fascinated by the dead man's cell phone because it allows her to connect with people she would otherwise never have known. At the same time, she also sees how the man's use of technology has created distance and disconnection in his relationships with the people around him. Overall, the play suggests that technology has both positive and negative effects on our connections with others, and it encourages the audience to think carefully about how they use technology in their own lives.
