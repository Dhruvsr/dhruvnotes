# Cinematic Theatre

Cinematic theatre is a form of storytelling that incorporates elements of film, such as camera angles, lighting, and sound effects, into the live experience of a theatrical performance. This approach to theatre is designed to create a more immersive and engaging experience for the audience, by using techniques that are typically associated with cinema. Some common elements of cinematic theatre include the use of projections, video, and sound design to create a rich and dynamic visual and auditory landscape. In my performance, I intend on using video projections. Video projections can be used in a variety of ways in cinematic theatre. One common use is to create a background or backdrop for the action on stage, allowing the audience to see a wider range of locations and settings without the need for physical sets. Video projections can also be used to create visual effects, such as superimposing images over the actors or using special effects to enhance the action on stage. In addition, video projections can be used to create a more dynamic and engaging experience for the audience by incorporating movement and changing images into the performance. Overall, the use of video projections in cinematic theatre can add a new level of visual interest and excitement to the performance.
