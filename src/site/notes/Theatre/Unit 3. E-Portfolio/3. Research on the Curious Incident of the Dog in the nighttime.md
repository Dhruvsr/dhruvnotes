Introduction to the original novel, the inspiration for the theatrical production:

“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time” is a novel by Mark Haddon that was published in 2003. It tells the story of a 15-year-old boy named Christopher Boone who has an autism spectrum disorder. The novel is written from Christopher's perspective, and it explores his experiences and emotions as he tries to solve the mystery of who killed his neighbour's dog.

  

One of the key themes in the novel is the difficulty that Christopher has in understanding and expressing his emotions. Because of his autism, Christopher has trouble interpreting the emotions of others and communicating his own feelings. This leads to misunderstandings and conflicts with the people around him, including his parents and his teacher.

  

Another important theme in the novel is the idea of truth and honesty. Christopher is extremely honest and logical, and he has difficulty understanding why people lie or deceive others. This causes problems for him when he tries to solve the mystery of the dog's death, because he doesn't know how to interpret the conflicting and sometimes dishonest statements of the people he talks to.

  

What are some theatre forms used in the play?

Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time is a play that employs several theatrical techniques to tell its story. Some techniques used include:

  

Physical Theatre: The play incorporates physical movements and gestures to convey emotions and actions. For example, the actor playing the main character, Christopher, often uses exaggerated movements to express his thoughts and feelings.

  

Brechtian Theatre: The play uses Brechtian techniques, such as breaking the fourth wall and using narration, to distance the audience from the action and make them think about the themes and ideas being explored.

  

Cinematic Theatre: The play uses sound and lighting effects to create atmosphere and set the mood. For example, the use of loud, jarring sounds to represent Christopher's sensory overload, or the use of lighting to create a sense of confinement in the scenes set in his home.

Use of Brechtian Techniques in the Curious Incident of the dog in the nighttime

  

Breaking the fourth wall: This is when the actors directly address the audience, breaking the illusion of the play and reminding the audience that they are watching a performance. In the play, Christopher frequently breaks the fourth wall to explain his thoughts and feelings, or to provide information about the story.

  

Narration: The play uses narration to provide background information and to move the story forward. The narrator in the play is Christopher's teacher, Siobhan, who reads from Christopher's diary and provides insight into his thoughts and experiences.

  

Alienation effects: Brecht believed that theatre should not simply entertain, but should also challenge and educate the audience. To achieve this, he used alienation effects, which are techniques that disrupt the audience's emotional response and make them think critically about the story. In the play, the use of sound and lighting effects, as well as Christopher's unique perspective, create alienation effects that challenge the audience's preconceived notions and encourage them to think about the themes of the play.

  

How has physical theatre been used in the making of the play?

  

Exaggerated movements: The actor playing Christopher often uses exaggerated movements to express his thoughts and feelings. For example, when he is overwhelmed by sensory input, he may flail his arms or cover his ears. This helps the audience to understand Christopher's emotional state and to empathize with him.

  

Use of props: The play uses props, such as balls and hula-hoops, to represent Christopher's thoughts and feelings. For example, when Christopher is trying to understand a complex concept, he may manipulate a ball to represent the idea in a tangible way. This helps to bring Christopher's internal world to life and to make it more accessible to the audience.

  

Ensemble work: The play also incorporates ensemble work, where the actors work together to create physical scenes and movements. For example, the actors may create a physical representation of a train station, with each actor playing a different role, such as a train conductor or a passenger. This helps to create a rich and dynamic physical world for the play.

  

Use of set design:

The set design in the play is minimalist and abstract. This helps to reinforce the themes of order and disorder, and to convey Christopher's unique perspective on the world.

  

Physical objects: In addition to the grid structure and projections, the set also includes physical objects, such as furniture and props, to create a sense of place and to represent Christopher's home and the other locations in the play.

  

Some of the ways that the set design is used in the play (other productions, and not the full play I observed) include:

  

This technique wasn’t used in Le Chat Noir’s production, but can be seen in others. 

Grid structure: The set is composed of a grid of white squares, which represents Christopher's love of order and his tendency to see the world in a linear, logical way. The grid also serves as a physical representation of Christopher's mind, with each square representing a different thought or memory.

Projections: The set also incorporates projections, which are used to create different locations and to convey information. For example, a map may be projected onto the grid to show Christopher's journey, or text may be projected to provide background information or to reveal Christopher's thoughts.
