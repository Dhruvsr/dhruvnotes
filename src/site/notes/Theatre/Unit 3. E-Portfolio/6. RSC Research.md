# Research on the Royal Shakespeare Company


The Royal Shakespeare Company, or RSC, is a world-renowned theatre company based in Stratford-upon-Avon, England. Founded in 1875, the RSC has a rich history of producing some of the most iconic plays and performances in the world.

  

One of the RSC's defining characteristics is its commitment to the works of William Shakespeare. The company was originally founded to provide a permanent home for the performance of Shakespeare's plays, and it continues to produce and perform his works to this day. In addition to Shakespeare, the RSC also produces a wide range of other plays, both classic and contemporary, and has a reputation for pushing the boundaries of theatre with its innovative productions.

  

Over the years, the RSC has built a reputation for excellence, and its productions are highly sought after by theatregoers around the world. The company has a long history of collaborating with some of the biggest names in theatre, and its productions have been seen by millions of people.

  

The RSC uses a wide range of lights and production elements in its productions. These elements are carefully designed and executed to enhance the storytelling and create a rich, immersive experience for audience members.

  

One of the key ways in which the RSC uses lights in its productions is to create atmosphere and mood. The lighting design for a play can help set the tone and establish the setting, whether it's a dark and brooding forest or a brightly lit medieval court. The use of colour is also an important part of the lighting design, with different colours used to evoke different emotions and create different effects.

  

In addition to atmosphere and mood, lights are also used to highlight key moments and actions in a play. For example, a sudden change in lighting can draw the audience's attention to a significant line or moment in the play, adding emphasis and impact to the scene.

  

The RSC also uses a range of other production elements, such as sets, costumes, and special effects, to bring its productions to life. The sets are carefully designed to create a realistic and believable world for the play, while the costumes help to establish the characters and their personalities. Special effects, such as smoke and pyrotechnics, can add an extra layer of excitement and drama to a production.

Projections can be used to create the illusion of a character flying or to simulate a storm, or could be used to aid emotive acting to display mental turmoil on stage.
