# Peking Opera
- When one thinks of the word 'opera', they might think of a high soprano 
- Peking Opera is said to have matured in Beijing and is a highly comprehensive theatre tradition that integrates music, singing, gesture, costume, movement, acrobatics, make-up, speech, and stagecraft that differentiates it from other forms today. 
- Peking Opera is a coalescence of multiple forms of Chinese opera, is the most popular due to being the most developed style. It is derived from different regional theatre forms from different parts of China, some of which originated during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) and gaining popularity within China in the Qing dynasty (1644-1911).  
- It rose in Beijing when four theatre troupes came to perform for the Imperial court for Emperor Qianlong’s birthday. These troupes were later known as the ‘four great Anhui companies’. One of the main performers, Gao Yueguan was sixteen years old when he performed for the Emperor and within 3 years, ascended to the leader of the group and led to it gaining popularity in the 19th century.
-   Chinese theatre, unlike Western theatre, is not divided into tragedy or comedy, but instead between “civilian” (wen) and “military” (wu) performances.
	-   Wu is focused on topics such as marriage, love, religion and righting injustice.
	-   Wen is focused on topics such as warfare and rebellion. Military plays are known for their acrobatic and gymnastic displays which represent experts soldiers in battles.
	-   Aside from the topic differences, the accompanying music and orchestra was also suited to the piece, with woodwind and string instrument used for wu performances and percussion instruments for wen performances.
-   Music has been an integral part of Peking Opera and thus there are various musical systems called shenqiang xitong. These include Kunqu (from Kunshan, near Shanghai) and  Pi-huang from Western China. 
-   Performers are classified into four basic types: sheng, who were the male main characters, dan, the female roles, jing males distinguished by their painted faces, and chou, the clowns that were identified by the patch of white paint wore over the centre of the face.
