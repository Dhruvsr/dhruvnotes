# Peking Opera Workshop Research
- Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. 
- Yu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu are two Peking Opera masters of the China National Peking Opera Company. Li Shengsu plays Yang, the main character in the opera "Drunken Concubine,"  a one-person show. 
- The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women.
