# Decoding the theatre practice
### Aesthetics
- Aesthetics refer to the visual, audio and tone of the performance. It is identified by watching various performances that serve as ambassadors of that practice. 
- The aesthetic can be determined by the material being formed or the conventions.
- Surface level: Beauty 
	- Underneath: The logic behind that beauty
		- Unless this ↑ isn't understood, the art can't be appreciated
			- In the presentation, explain various connotations and signs → semantics
- 'Aesthetics' are signals that transmit ideas, some of them connotated and some of them denotated. 
- A performance can be compared to a language with its own system of communication between the performer and audience. Sometimes, only a subset of the audience will understand certain elements. 

### Production Elements
- Anything occurring within a performance space—including the lights, sound and stage design—are culturally specific and have a subtle meaning behind them.
- As a theatre practitioner, we must be able to manipulate these production conventions (see Khouzan's 13 signs) to make the performance powerful. 

### Theatrical Conventions
- Specific conventions that make the theatre tradition unique, unchanging and passed down through time.
- These can be derived of the aesthetics, performance and production elements.
- Learning about theatrical conventions can help expand one's repertoire. 

### Making Connections
- It is important to make connections within and outside the cultural context. 
- International mindedness is the balance between your own culture and others
- Understand the belief systems and the role theatre plays in the people. It broadens our understanding of the world.
