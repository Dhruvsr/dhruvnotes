# Feedback for Chinayrah — Victorian Melodrama
- Presentation time: Approx. 6 minutes
- Short hook — You need to hook in the audience further. While the use of a rhetorical question is good, it is asking if we know what the Victorian era was, rather than an a "DID YOU KNOW".
- Good explanation of Victorian society which is the backbone of Victorian Melodrama
- Define what 'melodrama' is – remember that this is a varied audience
- It needs improvement in the narrative when the origin of VM is explained - focus on the chronological order
- Good that you mentioned the audience of Victorian melodrama 
- Some repetitiveness - mentioning exotic travel and nature twice
- Were there TVs during the time of Victorian melodrama? 
- You mentioned stock characters - explain them when it is relevant, and not later
- Good explanation of the conventions of VM
- You alluded to melodrama relating to Disney movies with no transition to the next paragraph.
- Gestures need to be improved
