# Dhruv's Case Study
Dhruv Ramu is a student in Grade 10, studying at an IB school in Bangalore, India. Dhruv has been at that school for many years and thus has fostered many friendships with his classmates and teachers. He enjoys learning and has a passion for science. He tends to score well on his examinations and enjoys attending school.
He is best at the subjects biology, language and literature, individuals and societies and chemistry, and enjoys them as well. He has an analytical mind and thus enjoys those criteria of humanities and L&L. 
He has various hobbies outside of school including playing the piano and a martial art called Tang Soo Do which he has been doing for approximately nine years. 
He also enjoys travelling and having a good general knowledge about the world and culture. He has chosen theatre as an art form and enjoys its structure in the MYP.
However, he also recognizes some of the issues which he faces in his day to day academic and personal life. He tends to be distracted and become disorganized quite easily, even when he tries to focus on what a certain person is saying. This causes him to "zone out" and lose track of what is occurring. Although he tends to be less forgetful now than he was a few years ago, he still forgets whether he has a certain item, or whether he has done a task. 

If a teacher is explaining a task in class, Dhruv may make an effort to pay attention, but then I shall forget what was discussed a few moments later despite not doing anything else at the same time. 
This also ties into his troubles with forgetfulness about tasks despite utilizing various tools for keeping track of tasks and time. Since he gets distracted easily, he adopts various methods to combat it including focus sessions. His desk gets messy very easily, and this furthers his unproductivity issue.
He tries to balance his subjects, his hobbies and his community service projects, but due to the aforementioned issues, it makes it difficult to do them all well. The high expectations which he has set for himself motivate himself to think of various ways to work on these issues, and he has seen improvement. He functions best in a busy environment where the surrounding bustle impacts him positively.
All in all, he continues to persevere through these troubles.
