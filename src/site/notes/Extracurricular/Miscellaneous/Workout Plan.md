#### Detailed Desc:
1.  Planks: Planks are a great exercise for strengthening the core muscles, including the abs, back, and shoulders. To do a plank, start in a push-up position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Hold this position for 30 seconds, then rest for 30 seconds. Repeat for 3-4 sets.
2.  Push-ups: Push-ups are a classic exercise for strengthening the arms, chest, and core. To do a push-up, start in a plank position with your hands placed slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body down until your chest touches the ground, then push back up to the starting position. Repeat for 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
3.  Lunges: Lunges are a great exercise for strengthening the legs and core. To do a lunge, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then step forward with one leg and lower your body down until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Push back up to the starting position, then repeat with the other leg. Do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps on each leg.
4.  Squats: Squats are another effective exercise for strengthening the legs and core. To do a squat, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hands extended in front of you. Lower your body down as if you were sitting back into a chair, then push back up to the starting position. Do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
5.  Bicep curls: Bicep curls are a good exercise for strengthening the biceps muscles in the arms. To do a bicep curl, hold a pair of dumbbells with your palms facing up and your arms at your sides. Curl the weights up towards your shoulders, then lower them back down. Do 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps.
