- What we end up doing is transferring modality from a textbook into a doc which isn't useful
- Instead:
	- Try to figure out what is important in what you are reading
	- How do I want to prepare myself to use this textbook and easily review
- Don't do content switching or multitasking because 20% of time is spent switching between tasks
- Think about reading and notetaking completely separately 
- Mark on notable topics into the margins if possible
- Focus on big ideas and then hone in on the smaller details
- Look for what question could come out of what you just read
- After reading, come back into focus into note taking
- Notion *can* be used for note taking (but I prefer hand notes for STEM)
- Give time for reviewing notes and don't spend all the time on note taking
- Systematically come back to notes every week or so
