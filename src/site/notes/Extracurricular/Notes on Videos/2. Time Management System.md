## Introduction
- Break down the system into four phases
- Phase 1: Collection system
	- Collect due dates and deadlines and different activities to do
- Phase 2: Monthly Planning System
- Phase 3: Daily/Weekly Planning
- Phase 4: Win the Hour

### Phase 1: Collection System
- Notion can be used to plan tasks
- So can Todoist (for me)

### Phase 2: Monthly Planning 
- Could use Google Calendar to view upcoming tasks (Todoist ports to GCal)
### Phase 3: Daily/Weekly
- Use Google Calendar to make sure that tasks are being followed, and that they don't clash
-  Make sure to have a buffer system
- Plan the next day the night before
### Phase 4: Conquering Hours
- Get to work once the schedule is set in stone
- Use Pomodoro timer like Pomatez
- Can use instrumental music
- Keep desk clear and ready for tasks
