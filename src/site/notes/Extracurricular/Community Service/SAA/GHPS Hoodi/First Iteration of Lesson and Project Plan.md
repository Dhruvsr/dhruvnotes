# Project Plan 📓
- Dhruv and Akhilesh will be undertaking a project where they will visit government schools lacking in facilities and resources, and teach the students information technology.
- We will also teach them about various payment gateways and platforms so that they can teach their parents to help facilitate the move to a more cashless economy.
- The end outcome will involve semi-autonomous learning where the knowledge we have imparted will help the current batch of students, who can help teach their juniors, and so on.
- We will also use a Raspberry Pi, a low-cost CPU which can help us cheaply deploy computers in the school. We aim to have 1-2 computers in the class depending on its strength. Additionally, we will also be looking out for second-hand laptops and desktop computers which we can use.

Note: The plan focuses majorly on FOSS software, in order to minimize cost, and
convey lessons about data privacy on the internet. Where ZorinOS is mentioned, it
can be substituted for Windows, when that operating system is accessible. If not,
one must note that Zorin was designed to be as similar to Windows as possible;
all Windows applications will function on it as well. The curriculum is targeted at
students in grades 6–8.

## 1 Phase 1: Introduction to Computers

### 1.1 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

```
1.1.1 Intended Conceptual Learning Outcomes
The student should be able to explain:
 What a computer is
 The usefulness of computers
 Parts of a computer
*Neev Academy,<akhilesh.balaji.bangalore@gmail.com>
Neev Academy,<dhruv.ramu@gmail.com>
```

```
 What an operating system is
 Methods of interaction with computers
```
## 2 Phase 2: Interaction with Computers

### 2.1 Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

2.1.1 Intended Conceptual Learning Outcomes
The student should be able to explain:
 How does the internet work?Routers, Modems, ISP, etc.
 The importance of the internet and how online communication is helpful
 The gaining of access to various local and global news sources
 Multimedia sharing websites such as YouTube and why it is important
 The importance of staying safe on social media, and using FOSS software to
maximize online privacy

2.1.2 Intended Practical Learning Outcomes
The student should be able to:
 Navigate the Zorin operating system—going over preinstalled applications,
how to shut down, restart and power on the computer
 Use the internet

- How to connect to the internet
- Basic internet troubleshooting
- What needs and does not need a WiFi connection
 How to open and use web browsers (specifically Mozilla Firefox)

 How to create an email ID and send emails.

## 3 Phase 3: Exploiting the Power of Computers

### 3.1 Intended Learning Outcomes

3.1.1 Intended Conceptual Learning Outcomes
The student should be able to explain:
 Why computers are better at certain tasks than humans
 The history of computers in terms of the lambda calculus and Turing machines


```
 The ideas behind programming a computer
```
- Programming through machine code, assembly code, and a programming
    language
 Logic gates (throughMMLogic)
 The ideas, in coding, of:
- Variables
- Data structures (majorly primitive)
* Arrays
* Strings
* Numbers
- Loops & basic control structures

3.1.2 Intended Practical Learning Outcomes
The student should be able to:
 Create basic shapes, letters, and fractals usingMSWLogo(to effectively teach
control structures, whichMSWLogois good at demonstrating)
 UseScratchto create basic games or storyboards (without the use of the
penor trigonometric functions), using:

- Broadcasts
- Functions
- Control structures
- Data structures
