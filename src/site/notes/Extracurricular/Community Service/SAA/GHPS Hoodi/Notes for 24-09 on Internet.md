### Internet
**What is internet?**
- Internet is a network of networks that is used to interlink many different types of computers all over the world
**Internet vs Intranet:**
- Internet
	- Internet is a public network
	- Any one can access the internet 
	- Unlimited users
	- Internet is less secure
	- Internet is made up of LAN, MAN and WAN
	- There is no owner of the internet
	- Internet can be used to share information around the world 
- Intranet
	- Intranet is a private network
	- Only members of the company can access the intranet
	- Limited users
	- Intranet is more secure
	- Intranet is for LAN
	- Intranet can be used to share secret information within an organisation

**Network Architecture:**
- Network architecture means network layout that tells us how computers are arranged and how tasks are allocated to the computer
- Types:
	- Peer to peer network architecture where all the computers are linked directly with equal privileges and no server
		- Advantages:
			- Cheaper because no server
			- If one computer stops working it will not affect the network
			- Setup and maintenance is easy
		- Disadvantages:
			- Security issues
			- The data cannot be backed up because there is no server
	- Client server network architecture where a client makes a request to the server and the server will fulfil that response

### Browser
- A computer program with a graphical user interface for displaying and navigating between web pages.
- *Show them how to use the web browser*
