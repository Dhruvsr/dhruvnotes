#  Pinhole Mask  Display
- What is a pinhole occluder?
	- An opaque disk with one or more small holes through it mainly used by ophthalmologists to test visual acuity.  
	- It focuses light, similar to a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. This is because light passes only through the centre of the eye's lens, and hence defects in the shape of the lens  have no  effect.  
- What is a parallax barrier?
	- A parallax barrier  is placed in front of an image source e.g. an LCD screen
- The display can have pinholes of  size 75 micrometers that are 390 micrometers apart. It is recommended that the pinhole mask has depth in the ballpark of 4-6mm because it  can allow for outerpixels that are covered by the pinhole  to be more visible. Light rays  from the  outer pixels travel at an angle through the pinhole mask and will miss the pupil if the angle is too large.
