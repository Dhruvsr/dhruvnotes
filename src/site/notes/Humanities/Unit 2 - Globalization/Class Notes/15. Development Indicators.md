# HDI - Dis/advantages
Assertions:
1. HDI is the best measure of development because it  provides a more accurate picture of the  economic state of the country
2. HDI isn't the best measure because it doesn't include social factors and other qualitative measures

* GDP is a monetary measure and fails to observe the quality of goods and services produced. It does not look into how income is distributed in society.
* HDI attempts to capture multiple aspects in a simple, composite index. It involves life expectancy, educational attainment, and income, measured by GDP per capita. This allows for a comparison of division of wealth within the country's  population. 
* Limitations:
	* Doesn't take gender into account
