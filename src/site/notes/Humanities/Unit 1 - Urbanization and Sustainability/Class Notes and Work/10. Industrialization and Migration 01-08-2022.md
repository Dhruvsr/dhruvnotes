# Industrialization and Migration
- The nineteenth century witnessed many mass migrations in Europe. Millions of people moved between 1750-1914.

| Origin               | Destination    | Time frame | Estimated number of people |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Africa               | Americas       | 1750-1830  | 9,000,000                  |
| Europe               | Americas       | 1850-1914  | 40,000,000                 |
| India/China          | Southeast Asia | 1860-1914  | 38,000,000                 |
| Russia, China, Japan | Central Asia   | 1870-1914  | 26,000,000                 |
- The Atlantic slave trade was still occurring in the early 19th century, so many enslaved Africans were forcefully brought to the Americas. 
- However, as the slave trade was criminalized, the migration of Africans reduced. 
- The population of Europe was surging, and life was becoming harder, hence they decided to move to the Americas. 
- At the same time, the populations of China and India were increasing, and Russia was encouraging its people to settle in Central Asia and Serbia.
- Meanwhile, the rural → urban migration was a lot as well. Many farmers' land was taken away from them in Europe for the purpose of industrialization.
- Conflict also influenced migrations, such as a conflict in the Balkans led to refugees fleeing to Europe, the Ottoman Empire and the Americas.
- Famines were taking place as well. India faced two famines, with the high-end mortality estimate being 29.3 million.
- Colonialism was also a huge pull factor during this period. There was a demand for labour and infrastructure such as railroads and mines.

| The above two sources indicate a clear correlation between industrialization and rural → urban migration. This is because many rural lands owned by farmers were used for the purpose of creating factories, and the developing economy was urban-centric. Additionally, better healthcare, transportation and housing was available in urban areas. | The information shows a correlation between the population/class distribution and the distribution of the urban population of various classes. | If gentrification is a consequence of urbanization, is the long term usefulness sufficient to negate the short term troubles faced by the lower class? |
