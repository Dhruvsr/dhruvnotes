# Dhruv's Digital Garden 🌱

**Hello, and welcome to** <mark class="Green">Dhruv's Digital Garden!</mark> 
In this repository, you will be able to navigate through the intricacies of my **second brain** 🧠; a repository of my online notes.
This isn't the *full access* to all my notes, but through this directory you will be able to access the ones that I wish to keep <mark class="Red">public</mark>. 
**If I have linked you to a specific note and you arrive here**, you may be confused. If this is the case please go to the exact link which I may have sent you to avoid any confusion.
