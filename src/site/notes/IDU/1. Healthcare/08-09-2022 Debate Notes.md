# Notes on Debate
### Self reflection
We advocated for the inclusion of elective surgeries under currently existing universal healthcare insurance programmes offered by various governments. The arguments were structured to detail the necessity of elective surgeries—such as organ transplants—and the fact that it tends to be very expensive, thus there is a need for it to be covered by universal healthcare insurance. My closing argument consisted of the use of literary devices such as rhetorical questions, addressing the audience/opposition dire

**LP3:**
*Is it ethical for pharmaceutical companies to raise prices of drugs that majorly impact a section of affected peoples quality of life?*  
LP3A: Patient/Community
LP3B: 
- Argument 1 by LP3B: "Misinformation"
- Argument 1 by LP3A: "What really is the purpose of producing drugs?"
- Argument 2 by LP3B: "Development and research of drugs takes years, billions of dollars and finest research..." → It is not feasible to sell drugs so cheaply
- Argument 2 by LP3A: "Extended monopoly", pharmaceutical companies attempting to maintain maximum market share whilst taking advantage of legal loopholes.
- Argument 3 by LP3B: "We don't increase prices to make more money"
- Argument 3 by LP3A: Focusing on pathos—an actual example of 'Alex Smith'. Very powerful argument. 
- Closing Argument by LP3B: We will need more money to develop, we are a business not a charity, etc

The points were clearly presented by LP3B and refuted the arguments well, although it lacked actual evidence or backing to their claims. Why not give an example of a lossmaking pharmaceutical company? LP3A effectively gained sympathy from the audience, but could not construct logical arguments with regards to economics and suggesting possible methods to pharmaceuticals. 


**LP4:**
*Should the drug recipes given to governments be open to the entire pharmaceutical industry after the patent expires?*
- Opening Argument by LP4A: Could, Should, Would we make "pharmaceuticals open source"? This isn't a Reddit post complaining about Microsoft and their proprietary software.
- Opening Argument by LP4B: Necessity of protecting intellectual property
- Argument 1 by LP4A: Preventing monopolies, many pharmas can produce the same drug, reducing the price and make it more accessible to those that need
- Argument 1 by LP4B: Expensive costs of R&D
- Closing Argument by LP4A: The ability to create a profit within 15 years depends on the company
The arguments presented by LP4B have logical fallacies, and were repetitive. LP4A's concluding statement was well formed, accurate, and logic based.
