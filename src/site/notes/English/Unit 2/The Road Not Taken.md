# The Road Not Taken
**Robert Frost**

The effects of the choice that he makes is as a result of his own decision; he might be able to travel on the other road again, or not, but he doesn't have to worry about where the road will take him, and his destination will be for better or worse, but has made a "difference" in his thinking, which he will look back on with a sigh. If we live our lives constantly thinking about other possibilities, we will live our lives with regret.
