###### What is the purpose or the message being communicated?
This speech is calling for equal rights for both “black boys and black girls” and “white boys…”, they will continue protesting and fighting for their rights, “going to jail together” until they are granted equal rights. He conveys that he is envisioning such a future, and if this future does not become a reality, America cannot be a “great nation”. 

###### What devices were used? Can you explain the effect?
This speech is one of the most powerful examples for the use of anaphora. MLK Jr repeats “I have a dream” multiple times—it makes his statements memorable and (quite literally) resonate with the crowd. Other repeated phrases include “One hundred years later”, “Now is the time”, “We can never be satisfied”, and “Let freedom ring” when he says that freedom will ring not in a few states, but across the country. 
Allusion is also used in this speech, as we can see the speaker alluding to various events and documents in American history. He uses "five score years ago" to refer to the Gettysburg address, and  “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness” to allude to the Lincoln Memorial, where this is set. He also uses biblical allusions such as "...came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity”
Apart from anaphora, he reiterates and repeats certain concepts so that they are remembered by the audience. He also utilizes imagery to describe the "mountain tops" from which "freedom (should) ring". There is also the use of metaphors as he compares the struggles and racism experienced by Black Americans to a "long night of captivity", and a "joyous daybreak" when social reforms are made and freedom is truly granted. He also uses the words "sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice." Finally, alliteration is also used to repeat the same sounds such as "dark and desolate" and "sweltering summer".

###### What aspects did the speech cater to ? [[English/Unit 2 - Who's My Leader/Ethos, Pathos, Logos Recap (27-09-2022)|Ethos, Pathos, Logos]]

[[English/Unit 2 - Who's My Leader/Ethos, Pathos, Logos Recap (27-09-2022)#Ethos|Ethos]] is used here because the speaker—MLK Jr—is already credible; he is a Black man speaking about a cause where he is affected. Additionally, he has been a civil rights leader for some time and is popular among this community. This automatically gives him an advantage. Pathos is also used as he uses imagery and metaphors to show the suffering of a Black American despite the Emancipation Proclamation. He says that they are "living on a lonely island of poverty"—ostracized in their own country. He brings up his own children as a symbol for the adults of the future, talking about how it is his own "dream" that they will be judged not by the "colour of their skin" but the "content of their character." Logos is used to explore the 'logic' behind a circumstance; MLK references the constitution and the Declaration of Independence, as well as the Emancipation proclamation to back up his points that the Black Americans have been given a "bad check, marked insufficient funds". Through facts talking about how Black Americans cannot stay in "motels on the highways, or hotels in the cities", he communicates that segregation must be abolished.
