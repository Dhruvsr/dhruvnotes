- Medium shot: It is the most common shot in movies and usually follows the first establishing shot. The subject is in the middle, distance permitting some of the background to be seen. A normal lens that sees what the human eye sees is usually used for medium shots. 
- Close-up: A type of shot which tightly frames a person or an object. They display the most detail but do not include the broader scene. 
- Extreme close-up: Any shot that zooms in very close to a particular part of a subject. Usually focuses on a particular part of a person, object or animal. Can show subtle emotions well. These shots are very intense. They are generally preceded by a wide shot. 
- Master shot: An entire dramatized scene from start to finish from an angle that keeps all the actors in view. It is often a long shot and can sometimes perform a double function as an establishing shot. 
- Over the shoulder shot: A shot of someone or something taken from the perspective or camera angle from the shoulder of another person. This shot is common when two characters are having a discussion and it will usually follow an establishing shot to help the audience place the characters in their setting. 
- High-angle shot: The camera looks down on a subject from a high angle. Can be used to show vulnerability or powerlessness. 
- Low-angle shot: A shot from a camera angle positioned low on the vertical axis anywhere below the eye line looking up. Can be used to make the subject look more powerful and strong.  
"
Newspaper article	There are different kinds of artices, maybe to present a political view or a how to do article, human interest story (feature article). The tone is different. The writer of the article takes a stance. Direct quotes and anecdotes are used to inherently influence the audience and keep them engaged. Based on the topic, the register has to fit. An article has a byline and it might have an introduction of the topic for the reader to understand. Articles are slightly longer than a report or editorial and they can be on pretty much any topic. 
Newspaper report	A report is much more factual and more informative. Answers basic questions - who, what, when, why, how?
Human interest story	A human interest story uses real life people and real life incidents. It usually includes photos and quotes. The story must open the reader's mind to something new (change the way they look at something.) Human interest stories get the reader to feel something at the end and is very descriptive so that the readers understand/ picture the story in their mind. Structural outline: 1. Introduction - needs to be concise, provide a base for the body to continue. 2. Body - where the story-telling takes place, logical, has quotes. 3. Conclusion - efficiently summarise what was presented, ensuring a link between all the elements - emotional appeal. (Not really news that you 'need' to report on)
Poster 	Event, when it is happening, where it is happening. 
Films 	" Point-of-view shot: Shows what a character is looking at (like their eyes are the camera). It is usually established by being positioned between a shot of a character looking at something and a shot showing the character’s reaction. 
- Dutch angle: A type of camera shot in which the camera angle is deliberately slanted to one side. It is an unnatural shot that is often used to portray psychological uneasiness or tension in the subject being filmed. 
- Dolly zoom: An unsettling in-camera effect that appears to undermine normal visual perception. The effect is achieved by zooming in or out while the camera dollies toward or away from the subject in such a way to keep the subject the same size in the frame throughout. 
- Long take: An uninterrupted shot in a film which lasts much longer than the conventional editing. Long takes are often accomplished through the use of a dolly shot or steadicam shot. Long takes of a sequence filmed in one shot without any editing are rare in films. "
Screenplay 	"- Slugline - with has EXT or INT to signify exterior or interior. It tells you where the scene takes place and what time in the day/ point in the day (this is not extremely specific, eg. midmorning). Also specifies setting
- Action - action is described underneath the slugline and between the dialogue. IT describes the actions of the characters but also covers mise en scene such as what the characters are wearing, vehicles, weapons and other props. 
- Character line - The character speaking has to be identified. A character line is simply the character’s name in block capitals. This line can also provide information about whether the character speaks off screen (O.S.) or not or via a voice over (V.O.)
- Dialogue - Can be shown as a single dialogue or as dual  dialogue when two people speak at the same time. Dialogue is placed directly underneath the character’s name - centre of the page.

## Task 2
Novel (fiction)	"Narrative elements: 
- Setting: The setting is the time and location in which your story takes place. Settings can be very specific, but can also be more broad and descriptive. A good, well-established setting creates an intended mood and provides the backdrop and environment
- Character: There is usually a protagonist and an antagonist. There are also central characters which are vital to the development of the protagonist and the plot. 
- Plot: The plot is the sequence of events that connect the audience to the protagonist and their ultimate goal. There are also sub plots and pinch points. 
- Conflict: The conflict drives the story and creates tension. This is what makes the story interesting to the audience.

- Setup: The world in which the protagonist exists prior to the journey. The setup usually ends with the conflict being revealed.
- Rising Action: The series of obstacles the protagonist must overcome. Each obstacle is usually more difficult and with higher stakes than the previous one.
- Climax: The point of highest tension, and the major decisive turning point for the protagonist.
- Resolution: The conflict’s conclusion. This is where the protagonist finally overcomes the conflict, learns to accept it, or is ultimately defeated by it. Regardless, this is where the journey ends."
Dialogue	"- Each speaker gets a new paragraph. Every time someone speaks, you show this by creating a new paragraph. Yes, even if your characters are only saying one word, they get new paragraphs.
- Each paragraph is indented. The only exception for this is if it’s the start of a chapter or after a scene break, where the first line is never indented, including with dialogue.
- Punctuation for what’s said goes inside the quotation marks. Any time the punctuation is a part of the person speaking, they go inside the quotes so the reader knows how the dialogue is said.
- Long speeches with several paragraphs don’t have end quotations. You’ll see more on this below, but overall, if one character is speaking for so long they have separate paragraphs, the quotation marks on the end are removed, but you start the next paragraph with them.
- Use single quotes if the person speaking is quoting someone. If you have a character who says, “He said ‘I’m fine’”, the single quotes indicate what someone else says."
Short story 	Never has a complete closed ending, there are stories of characters where hardly anything is going on but the story is taking place in the character's mind. There are also stories of action.

- Narrative opens in media res - in the middle. Flashbacks are usually used. "
Free verse (poetry)	There aren't any specific restrictions. The poet makes creative choices. However, the line length is fixed.
Sonnet (poetry)	The first twelve lines are divided into three quatrains with four lines each. In the three quatrains the poet establishes a theme or problem and then resolves it in the final two lines, called the couplet. The rhyme scheme of the quatrains is abab cdcd efef. The couplet has the rhyme scheme gg. There are 14 lines in total. This is a love song by nature, so it will be able love. There may be a sudden shift in focus, for example, if you are talking about your beloved and then you move to a more universal image of love (volta in a petrarchan sonnet)

The language is informal as diaries are usually not intended to be read by a large audience and are extremely personal (shows internal thoughts).
