# Speak for Success
**27-09-2022**

Notes from [Leadership Skills: The 5 Essential Speaking Techniques](https://www.genardmethod.com/blog/leadership-skills-the-5-essential-speaking-techniques)

Along with the use of [[English/Unit 2 - Who's My Leader/Ethos, Pathos, Logos Recap (27-09-2022)#Ethos Pathos and Logos|Ethos, Pathos and Logos]], there are essential conventions which must be followed to successfully deliver a speech.
- In order to persuade an audience, the speaker must be aware of the needs and desires of the audience. Having knowledge of how the audience thinks, and what they are expecting from the speech can help strengthen it.
- Three Cs: Clear, Concise and Consistent:
	- By keeping speeches crisp and short, it makes them <mark class="Pink">memorable</mark> and does not bore the audience. A speech with heightened vocabulary that goes on for two hours is not nearly as powerful as a persuasive one for two minutes. 
	- Example: Edward Everett was a highly skilled orator that gave an address during the American Civil War for two hours. Right after, Abraham Lincoln gave one of the most famous speeches in history: the Gettysburg Addressâ€”it was no more than 271 words. Therefore, impact is not correlated with speech length.
- The <mark class="Aqua">intonations</mark> and speech conventions can also increase how impactful it is. For example, Narendra Modi uses brilliant oratory skills wherein he uses intonations and changes in tone. Making short pauses can allow for the words to sink in to the audience.
- Along with oration, body language and hand gestures can improve the speech through pacing, making eye content with the audience, &c.
- A call to action is also useful. The impact of a persuasive speech can be reinforced through a call to action at the end of the piece which encourages the audience to do something.
