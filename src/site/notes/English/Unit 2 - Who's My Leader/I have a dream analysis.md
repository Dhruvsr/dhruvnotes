###### What is the purpose or the message being communicated?
This speech is calling for equal rights for both “black boys and black girls” and “white boys…”, they will continue protesting and fighting for their rights, “going to jail together” until they are granted equal rights. He conveys that he is envisioning such a future, and if this future does not become a reality, America cannot be a “great nation”. 

###### What devices were used? Can you explain the effect?
This speech is one of the most powerful examples for the use of anaphora. MLK Jr repeats “I have a dream” multiple times—it makes his statements memorable and (quite literally) resonate with the crowd. Other repeated phrases include “One hundred years later”, “Now is the time”, “We can never be satisfied”, and “Let freedom ring” when he says that freedom will ring not in a few states, but across the country. 
Allusion is also used in this speech, as we can see the speaker alluding to various events and documents in American history. He uses "five score years ago" to refer to the Gettysburg address, and  “Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness” to allude to the Lincoln Memorial, where this is set. He also uses biblical allusions such as "...came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity”
Apart from anaphora, he reiterates and repeats certain concepts so that they are remembered by the audience.
He also utilizes imagery to describe the "mountain tops" from which "freedom (should) ring"
