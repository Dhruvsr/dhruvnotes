**Transcript available [here](https://constitutionaldemocracyproject.org/file_download/inline/682fcb20-ff20-40e7-927d-3e99be5a356f)**
##### Context
This speech was delivered in the midst of a bloody civil war. Unions had recently defeated Confederate troops at the Battle of Gettysburg. Lincoln realized he must inspire the public. 

### Line by Line Analysis
> [!QUOTE] 1.
> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
- Four score and seven → 87 years ago, just a more elegant way of saying it
- He is reminding the audience of the principles on which the nation has been founded: liberty and equality
> [!QUOTE] 2.
> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.
- "Great civil war" → because of the cause: emancipation of slaves
- "nation" is repeated to signify that the unified body of the US must endure this civil war
- Parallelism—reinforcing the idea of nation through multiple lines mentioning it
- It is "great" because the actions here will echo throughout the world; America was a democracy and this will set a precedent around the world. 
> [!QUOTE] 3.
> We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
- Lincoln is recognizing the fallen soldiers (this speech takes place after the Gettysburg address)
- Use of emotive language "gave their lives so that the nation might live" to create contrast
- Use of "we" → inclusive language
- Use of consonance: "field", "final", "fitting"
> [!QUOTE] 4.
> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate, we can not hallow this ground.
- Repeating "can" - triples to make it memorable
> [!QUOTE] 5.
> The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract.
- "consecrate" - make the ground blessed or holy - the deaths of the soldiers
- Accentuating the sacrifice of the soldiers and civilians—he doesn't want to sound patronizing or insincere. He says that their actions are louder than his own words.
- Alliteration of "poor power"
> [!QUOTE] 6.
> The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
- Echoing the same sentiments that actions speak louder than words.

> [!QUOTE] 7.
> It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us — that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion — that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain — that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom — and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth

> Omission of conjuctions 

> [!FAQ] Definition of Polysyndeton
> Repeated use of conjunctions in close succession
- Use of inspirational words to inspire the audience such as "nobly", "honored", "devotion", and "freedom"
- Use of contrasts "living" with "honored dead" and "shall have a new birth of freedom"
- Use of asyndeton
- A call to action to finish the task "remaining before us" because if we don't "dedicate" ourselves, their work has been for nothing "died in vain"
- They sacrificed their today for your tomorrow
- This speech simultaneously persuades, actuates and inspires.
- "new birth of freedom" → connection to "conceived"
- "of the people, by the people, for the people" → a highly quoted and powerful triple
