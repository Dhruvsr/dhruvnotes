**What is the organising or unifying principle of a particular part (volume, chapter, episode) in the novel Jane Eyre?**

One unifying principle of the novel is that there is an oscillation between 'rational' and 'irrational' settings, which is Lowood and Moorhouse for the former, and the latter being Gateshead and Thornfield. Each setting is thus a snapshot of the emotional and mental state of Jane. Gateshead features a passionate, superstitious and young Jane, while Lowood has a colder, harder and more constrained Jane. Thornfield is personal, symbolic and superstitious. Moor House is conventional and stifling once again, concluding in Ferndean which features happiness and delight, being the désinence of the story. In addition, the chapters can be viewed as episodes, intertwined with each other, but still independent as they may have differences in setting or scenario.

**Identify the hierarchy of structure in Jane Eyre and the rationale behind it**

Jane Eyre follows the Three Act Structure, which is an enhanced version of the Freytag's Pyramid. Each "act" of the story is part of the overarching plot, but focuses on a different factor. The first act is the exposition, and introduces us to Jane's family members that mistreat her, and an early insight into her troubled childhood. It then transitions towards Lowood, as we get introduced to her character as a growing woman, culminating in her new post as a governess at Thornfield. Act two is the rising action, as Jane faces setbacks, ruminations, desire, romantic elements, a midpoint twist as she abrubtly leaves Thornfield after an annulled marriage to go to Moor House, climaxing as she returns to Thornfield to find Mr Rochester, her true love. Thus, act three begins—the resolution. She marries Mr Rochester and all the waiting, contemplation, journeying has led up to that point. It ends as matters are resolved and Jane enjoys her (now) quiet life with Mr Rochester.
