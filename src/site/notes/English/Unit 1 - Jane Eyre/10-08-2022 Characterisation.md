# Characterisation
**How are characters developed?**
- Characters are developed through various connotative and denotative methods. The main elements include:
	- Speech: Character's personalities can be defined by their word usage and vocabulary. It can display intelligence (or lack of it), and the general speed of their speech can indicate their emotions at the time. An example of how speech is used to characterize Hannah, the housekeeper there. “Ye’ve not been used to sarvant’s wark, I see by you hands,” she remarked. “Happen ye’ve been a dressmaker?". It accentuates how North Jane has travelled. 
	- Thoughts: Looking into the minds of characters allows us to explore some of the thoughts which aren't conveyed aloud which can be powerful. In novels written in first person POV like Jane Eyre, the reader is able to understand far more about the protagonist.
	- Effect on Others: The relationship between various characters and the way characters are reacted to is also important as it informs the reader about how character(s) conduct themselves and helps the reader develop an informed perspective on the storyline.
	- Actions: The behaviours of various characters also contributes to the development of the character. It shows if a character is spiteful, foolish, joyful, broody, &c. In Jane Eyre, for example, we get to understand Jane's extended family—the Reeds—because of the way they behave at Gateshead.
	- Looks: The appearance of the character is important as well. The way they dress provides an insight into their own lives. Characters known to wear frivolous, "showy", and expensive dresses may contribute to the opinion of that character the narrator is creating.

**How do they help the narration progress?**
These characterization techniques help the narration progress because when amalgamated together, it is producing an intended effect on the reader, ensuring that they observe and absorb various elements of the story. The typical behaviour, appearance, and speech helps the reader 'know' the character better which helps to form a relationship between the reader and the book.

##### How has Jane's character developed in Gateshead?

Gateshead is the first setting which the reader is exposed to in the story. It is here where Jane as an adolescent is exposed to isolation and torment by the Reed family. Her initial upbringings were the proponents to her persona; she is not one to conform. For example, when John Reed threw a book at Jane, she lashed out—resulting in her being put in the "red-room"—the place where her uncle passed away. The evening before she leaves Gateshead for Lowood, she has a rather outspoken outburst towards Mrs Reed.

##### How has Jane's character developed in Lowood?
Lowood institutionalized Jane, turning her from a young, outspoken girl into an educated young woman. Initially, she is not used to the oppressive and repressive nature of Lowood; she befriends a girl named Helen Burns, surprised that she endured the abuse from the school staff without question. She finds solace in Mrs Temple, the school superintendent, and is branded as a sinner by Mr Brocklehurst. After a deadly typhus outbreak killing many pupils at Lowood, it attracted public attention, resulting in the discrediting of Mr Brocklehurst, putting an end to his immoral ways. However, Jane loses her friend Helen to tuberculosis and this leaves a lasting impression on her, making it difficult for her to cope. Nevertheless, after completing her schooling, she taught at the school for almost 2 years, then seeking to become a governess.

##### How has Jane's character developed in Thornfield?
Thornfield is an 'irrational' setting and is where she met the hero of the story—Mr Rochester—and it is where she attained maturity as she explored the feelings of love and desire. It was a large and ostentatious household, with an element of enigma as Mr Rochester's "crazy wife" is hidden away. She struggles to accept her own relationship with Mr Rochester, and this is where much of her feminism shines through—she finds herself speaking to him frankly, at times forthright. For example, one night Mr Rochester asked Jane if she thought him handsome and she answered in the negative. It is also where she experienced rejection as Jane and Mr Rochester's wedding was annulled because it was revealed that Rochester already had a wife, leaving Jane in a critical position.

##### How has Jane's character been developed in Moorhouse?
Jane was repressed in Moorhouse as she had been forced to conceal her identity. She experienced emaciation and near-starvation in the first few days of her leaving Thornfield, and then seeks refuge in the Rivers' household. She is reluctant to be a burden and keen to settle in her new surroundings, and becomes a schoolteacher at the local school and even has her own cottage. She realizes that she does not have to be alienated from society even after an unfortunate and humiliating turn of events. 

##### How has Jane's character been developed in Ferndean?
Jane's journey in this bildungsroman culminates in Ferndean, Rochester's new residence. It is where she finally becomes an "equal" to Mr Rochester, as he is blinded, disfigured and poorer than she. Due to Bertha Mason's death, she has a clear conscience and celebrates her own desire. Jane is fond of Adele and ensures that she is in a less strict school environment. She does not feel remorse towards St John when his impeding death is revealed, giving the reader a notion that she has become free.
