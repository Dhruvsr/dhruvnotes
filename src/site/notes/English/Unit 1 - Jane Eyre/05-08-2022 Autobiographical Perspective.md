**How does the autobiographical perspective of the first person affects all elements of the narrative?**
- Perspective and voice: The autobiographical perspective of the narrator is critical to the narrative of Jane Eyre. This is because some of the themes and symbolism present in Jane Eyre can only be conveyed if the perspective of the protagonist is clear to the audience. For example, the rumination and thoughtfulness of Jane as she thinks about her love for Mr Rochester cannot be given justice if it was narrated by another character. Jane Eyre is a bildungsroman; showing her intellectual and psychological growth  is best done in the point of view of the main character. The isolation she feels at Gateshead or the oppression at Lowoodâ€”powerful themes, can only be expressed with first person POV.
- Medium of narration: Given that the narrative is written in retrospect, the language is more refined and composed. Jane has undergone education and uses a diverse vocabulary.
- Autodiegetic narrator(Narrator who is also the protagonist - intimacy with the text & : An autodiegitic narrator can cause biases in the story. The reader is only exposed to the opinions Jane has of her surroundings, and this subjectivity may result in certain prejudices she may hold. For example, she may consider Mr Rochester to be a more affectionate and kind-hearted man than he really is, or due to the effects of her childhood  and her superstitious nature at the time, portrayed Mrs Reed in a worse light. 
- Reliability of the narrator - Who speaks? Who sees? The reliability of the narrator can be compromised due to the narrator being autodiegetic. For example, the reader's opinion of Blanche Ingram is not a good one; she imagines her to be beautiful, but money-minded, flamboyant, and pretentious. Jane is jealous and it may affect the reliability of the narrative. Everything in a first person POV narrative is hearsay; the reader is forced to form opinions solely based on the word of the narrator.
