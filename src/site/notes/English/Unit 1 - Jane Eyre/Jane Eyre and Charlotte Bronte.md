# How much of Jane Eyre is related to Charlotte Bronte?
- There are major instances in the novel which are similar to the encounters of Charlotte Bronte's childhood and experience.
- Charlotte's mother died when Charlotte was 5 years old, and Charlotte's aunt thus helped her brother in law by raising her. Charlotte and her three sisters—Maria, Elizabeth and Emily—were sent to Cowan Bridge, a school for clergymen's daughters in 1824. There, Maria and Elizabeth died in an outbreak of tuberculosis. This is referenced in the novel when Helen Burns, Jane's friend at Lowood died of TB as well.
- Charlotte became a private governess after teaching for a bit at the same school—just like how Jane taught at Lowood and then became a governess at Thornfield.
- The religious fervor of the headmaster, Mr Brocklehurst at Lowood is related to Reverend Carus Wilson, the minister who ran Cowan Bridge. Charlotte was angry at how she was treated and used it as a basis for Lowood.
- John Reed is portrayed as a rude and irresponsible cousin in the beginning of the novel, and later it is revealed that through a journey into alcoholism, crime and the squandering of money, he committed suicide, just like Charlotte's brother Branwell who was addicted to opiates and alcohol. 
- Due to these stylistic choices of ingraining some of her own life into her work, it provided an opportunity to express her true identity as she was writing under a pseudonym at the time. It also gave a realistic feel to the bildungsroman.
