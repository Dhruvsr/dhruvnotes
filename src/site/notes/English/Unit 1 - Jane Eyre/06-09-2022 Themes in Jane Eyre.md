# Themes in Jane Eyre
##### What are some of the themes in Jane Eyre?
1. Religion
2. Social status/class
3. Feminism/oppression due to gender
4. Gothic elements
5. Self-discovery
6. Passion
7. Beauty


##### Can you connect these themes to instances?
- Religion
	- Jane has encountered various interpretations and actions of Christians. She encounters Mr Brocklehurst's Evangelicalism which is not inculcated in his hypocritic and selfish behaviour, leading her to have a bitter experience with it. At Lowood, Helen tells her that she copes with circumstances through patience and forgiveness which Jane does not agree with either. St. John displays righteousness as he does "God's work", preparing to become a missionary in India. 
- Social position/class structure
	- This novel was set in the Victorian era when class differences were prevalent. A woman of the lower class could not marry a man of the upper class and vice-versa. Jane is seen as a "poor individual" despite being in the upper class household of the Reeds, being denounced as "lower than a servant". She competes with Ms Ingram who has a higher social standing, and explores her internal dichotomy of whether she should marry Mr Rochester or not. 
- Gender inequality
	- Congruent with class discrimination, Jane also experienced gender inequality. Her own job options were limited, and she witnessed first-hand the double standard that was prevalent at the timeâ€”Bertha Mason being locked in an attic despite being Rochester's wife, the the fact that solely the man can control a relationship, and such. She refuses to marry Mr Rochester until she is no longer his "mistress", but an equal.
