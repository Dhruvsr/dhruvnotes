- One of the important factors that would affect Jane Eyre if it was set in the 21st century was that the society was very different, as well as the [[English/Unit 1 - Jane Eyre/29-07-2022 Structure, Infographic, Setting|setting.]] The enforcing of various social norms would not be as strong, and the patriarchy, even in rural England would not be the same. 
- If Jane Eyre was born in the 21st century, the isolation would be different. Rather than physical isolation, in a digitized world, she may still feel isolated.
- The teaching methods and general life at Lowood including the use of violence to institutionalise children would exist either. The conventional idea of an English boarding school for the unfortunates would not be as prominent.

- Yet, the elements of Jane Eyre can't go obsolete. These ideas and [[English/Unit 1 - Jane Eyre/06-09-2022 Themes in Jane Eyre|themes]] still stand up today, even if slightly marred. 
- Jane Eyre is a [[English/Unit 1 - Jane Eyre/26-07-2022 Bildungsroman|bildungsroman]]. Without the [[English/Unit 1 - Jane Eyre/10-08-2022 Characterisation|character development]], it would no longer remain in this [[English/Unit 1 - Jane Eyre/02-08-2022 Class Wiki Entry on Bildungsroman|genre]].
