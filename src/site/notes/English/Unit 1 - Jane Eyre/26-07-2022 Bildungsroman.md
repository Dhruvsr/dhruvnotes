**How can Jane Eyre be considered a bildungsroman ?**
Jane Eyre can be considered a bildungsroman because Jane faces various setbacks as she ages. The book begins when she is aged 10 at Gateshead, unwillingly adopted by her aunt Mrs Reed. Jane does not have any companions and is neglected by John, Eliza and Georgina Reed, her cousins. She is referred to as "below the servants" and "mad cat". Typically, bildungsroman novels involve sending the protagonist away to a boarding school, prison or a far off land. In this case, she is sent to Lowood, a boarding school for orphaned girls, where she is branded as a "liar" and a sinner. She finds Helen Burns as a companion, and Mrs Temple as a caring teacher. Her next setbacks were seeing death all around her in the height of the typhus epidemic in the institution, along with the death of Helen. When she leaves Lowood and takes up a job as a governess at Thornfield, where she finds acceptance. She slowly builds her own identity, exploring romantic feelings, facing hardship when she is compelled to leave Thornfield for Moor house, and finally, the wheel comes "full circle" as she marries Mr Rochester. 


Self actualization is the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, in which it explores how humans, once their initial needs of shelter, food, companionship, etc are fulfilled, higher-order needs are the next priority, with the final one being self actualization, in which psychological development is completed, and personal potential is "actualized".
