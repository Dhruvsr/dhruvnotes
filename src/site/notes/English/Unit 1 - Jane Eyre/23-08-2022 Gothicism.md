# Gothicism (Style) in Jane Eyre
### What is Gothic Literature ?
- Gothic literature is writing that involves scenic and "dark" setting with an atmosphere of trepidation, fear and enigma. The supernatural elements tend to entertain both the reader and the character in the story. 
- Stories solely involving gothic literature can explore psychological trauma, mental illnesses and the evils of manâ€”as seen in texts by Edgar Allen Poe. These gothic horrors can show the disillusionment of life and captivate the reader as it explores strange and unfamiliar circumstances.
- Gothic architecture was prominent in the 16th century, resulting in many buildings inculcating some of these values, such as pointed arches, vaulted ceilings and grand designs. It was used in conjunction with language choices to accentuate the circumstances.

### Examples of Gothicism in Jane Eyre
- When Jane was mentioning the irregular habits of St John Rivers in the rational and oppressive setting of Marsh End, she expresses her view on his the "dark roof and hoary walls he called his home" and the "moors for the sake of their soothing silence".
- The moment Jane approached Thornfield she expressed the Gothicism present there:
	- "the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark".
	- "wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room,"
