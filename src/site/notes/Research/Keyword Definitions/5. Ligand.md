# Ligand
##### What is a Ligand?
A ligand is a chemical species that binds to a central atom or molecule in a [[Research/Keyword Definitions/6. Coordination Complex\|coordination complex]]. The ligand donates one or more pairs of electrons to form a coordinate covalent bond with the central atom or molecule. Ligands can be atoms, molecules, or ions, and can be either neutral or charged. In biochemistry, ligands are often small molecules that bind to proteins or other biomolecules, such as enzymes or receptors, to regulate their function or activity. Some common examples of ligands include metal ions, water, and organic molecules such as amines and carboxylates.
