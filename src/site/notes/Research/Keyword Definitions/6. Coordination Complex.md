# Coordination Complex
##### What is a Coordination Complex?
A coordination complex is a molecule or ion that contains a central atom or molecule bonded to one or more [[Research/Keyword Definitions/5. Ligand\|ligands]]. The ligands are bonded to the central atom or molecule through coordinate covalent bonds, which are formed when the ligand donates one or more pairs of electrons to the central atom or molecule. Coordination complexes are important in many chemical and biological processes, including enzyme catalysis, metal ion transport, and the absorption of light by pigments.

The central atom or molecule in a coordination complex is typically a metal ion, although it can also be a neutral metal atom or a nonmetal atom. The ligands can be atoms, molecules, or ions, and can be either neutral or charged. The arrangement of the ligands around the central atom or molecule is called the coordination sphere, and the number of ligands in the coordination sphere is called the <mark class="Aqua">coordination number</mark>. Coordination complexes can have coordination numbers ranging from 2 to as many as 16 or more, depending on the size and shape of the central atom or molecule and the ligands.
