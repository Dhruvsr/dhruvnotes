# X-ray Crystallography
### What is it?
- Used to find out the structure of proteins, nucleic acids, atomic structure, etc
- When a beam of x-rays is directed at a crystal, the arrangement of atoms within the crystal causes the x-rays to diffract, or bend, in a specific pattern. This pattern is known as the x-ray diffraction pattern, and it is unique to each type of crystal. The diffraction pattern is produced by the constructive and destructive interference of the x-rays as they pass through the crystal.
- The diffraction pattern is typically recorded on a detector, such as a film or a charge-coupled device (CCD), and can be analyzed using specialized software. By analyzing the diffraction pattern, researchers can determine the arrangement of atoms within the crystal, which in turn allows them to determine the structure of the molecule.
- The specific pattern of diffraction produced by a crystal is determined by the arrangement of atoms within the crystal, as well as the spacing between the atoms. This pattern can provide important information about the structure and function of the molecule and is an essential tool in structural molecular biology and other fields.
### Other/Additional Comments
- Might need to know Python/C, as well as an understanding of equipment used in x-ray crystallography
