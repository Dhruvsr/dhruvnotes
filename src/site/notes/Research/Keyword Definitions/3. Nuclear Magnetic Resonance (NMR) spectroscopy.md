# Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy
### What is it?
- Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a technique used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules. It works by exposing a sample of the molecule to a strong magnetic field and using radio frequency (RF) radiation to observe the behaviour of the nuclei. By measuring the resonance frequencies of different nuclei, researchers can determine the structure of the molecule and how its atoms are connected. NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for understanding the structures of small molecules and is commonly used in fields such as chemistry, biochemistry, and structural biology.

> [!FAQ] What is Magnetic Moment?
> A magnetic moment is a measure of the strength and direction of an object's magnetic field. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a magnitude and a direction. The magnetic moment of an object is related to the alignment of its magnetic moments, which are the intrinsic magnetic moments of its constituent particles. Electrons have an intrinsic magnetic moment because they are charged particles, and their spin gives them a small magnetic field.
