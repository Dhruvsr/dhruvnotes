# Protein-protein interactions
Protein-protein interactions are interactions between two or more proteins that play a role in the function of cells and organisms. Proteins are complex molecules that are involved in almost every aspect of cellular biology, including metabolism, signaling, and structural support. They perform these functions by interacting with other proteins, as well as with DNA, RNA, and small molecules.

Protein-protein interactions can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. These interactions can involve the entire protein, or just specific regions called domains. Protein-protein interactions are often highly specific, meaning that they occur between proteins that have complementary shapes and chemical properties.

Protein-protein interactions play a vital role in many biological processes, including cell division, gene expression, and immune response. They are also involved in many diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding protein-protein interactions is important for the development of new therapies and treatments for these diseases.
