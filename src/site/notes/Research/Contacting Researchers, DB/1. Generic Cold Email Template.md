Dear [Professor],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Dhruv Ramu and I am a Grade 10 student studying in Bangalore, India. I am the co-founder of a science magazine called The Geekly that has published twelve issues of 50 pages each. I am a passionate science student, and have always been interested in molecular biology.

I am writing to inquire about the possibility of conducting part-time research in your lab. I am confident that the experience I have gained through my involvement in the science magazine and my passion for molecular biology would make me a valuable addition to your research team.

I am aware that opportunities for part-time research for high school students may be limited, but I am eager to learn and contribute in any way that I can. I am available to work after school and on weekends, and would be happy to discuss my availability with you further. If you do not have availability, it would be great if you could connect me to someone else who might be able to offer me a research opportunity.

I appreciate your consideration and look forward to hearing from you.

In addition, here is my [CV].

Sincerely,
Dhruv Ramu
